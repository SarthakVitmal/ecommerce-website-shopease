Personal Finance Tracker
A web application designed to help users track their income, expenses, and budgets with intuitive data visualizations. This project leverages the MERN stack to deliver a full-stack solution for personal finance management.

Features
1. User Authentication
Secure user registration and login using JWT authentication.
Passwords stored using secure hashing (bcrypt).
2. Income and Expense Management
Add, edit, and delete income and expense entries.
Categorize transactions into predefined categories (e.g., Food, Rent, Travel).
View and manage a history of all transactions.
3. Budget Tracking
Set monthly or yearly budget goals.
Track spending against the set budget in real time.
4. Data Visualization
Pie Chart: Displays spending breakdown by category.
Bar Chart: Shows income vs. expenses over time.
5. Export Reports
Download financial data as PDF or Excel files for offline use.
6. Notifications (Optional)
Get notified when spending nears or exceeds the budget.
Technology Stack
Frontend
React.js: For building a dynamic user interface.

Axios: For communicating with the backend.
Backend
Node.js: Server-side runtime environment.
Express.js: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
JWT: For secure authentication.
Database
MongoDB: For storing user data, transactions, and budgets.
Mongoose: For schema modeling.
Additional Tools
dotenv: For managing environment variables.
bcrypt: For secure password hashing.
Cors: To enable cross-origin requests.
How It Works
1. User Flow
Sign Up/Log In:

New users can register and log in securely.
Token-based authentication ensures secure session management.
Dashboard:

Users land on a dashboard showing:
Current month's income and expense totals.
Spending breakdown (Pie Chart).
Monthly trends (Bar Chart).
Add Transactions:

Users can add, edit, or delete income/expense entries.
Each entry includes:
Type (Income/Expense).
Category (e.g., Rent, Food).
Amount and Date.
Set Budgets:

Users can set budget goals for a specified time period.
Real-time notifications alert users when they exceed budgets.
View Reports:

Users can download financial summaries as PDF or Excel files.
2. Backend Flow
Authentication:

Upon registration, user credentials are securely hashed and stored in MongoDB.
Logged-in users receive a JWT token for session management.
Transactions:

Each transaction is linked to the user's unique ID.
MongoDB stores all income and expense records.
APIs:

RESTful APIs manage user data and transactions.
Example endpoints:
POST /api/auth/register
GET /api/transactions
Data Visualization:

Backend aggregates data for charts, which are rendered on the frontend.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed.
MongoDB set up locally or on the cloud (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
